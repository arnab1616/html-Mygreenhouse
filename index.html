          <h2>Lavender</h2>
          <p>
            Lavender's lovely scent is known to reduce anxiety and calm the
            mind. The calming fragrance of a lavender plant is thought to
            provide relief from stress, depression, and migraines. It is also
            considered anti-inflammatory and has antiseptic properties.

          <h2>Water Lily</h2>
          <p>
            Water lilies are plants that grow in still or slowly moving water.
            They like ponds, streams, and the edges of lakes in tropical and
            mild areas. Their floating leaves are often called lily pads. Frogs
            like to sit on them.

          <h2>Rose</h2>
          <p>
            Their petals are edible and rose water (made from soaking the petals
            in water) is often added to jellies or jams, or is used as flavoring
            in Indian and Chinese dishes. Roses also grow a berry-shaped fruit
            called rose hips. The fruit can be orange, red, dark purple, or even
            black.
